Although you wouldn't want to do much busy waiting in your production code, 
testing is a different matter. When testing asynchronous systems, 
it's very helpful to wait for some scenario to finish its course. 
busypie helps you perform busy waiting easily and expressively. 

## Quickstart
Most typical usage will be in test, when we have a scenario 
that require us to wait for something to happen.
```python
from busypie import wait, SECOND

def test_create_user():
    create_user_from(USER_DETAILS)
    wait().at_most(2, SECOND).until(lambda: is_user_exists(USER_DETAILS))
```
